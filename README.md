# PlantBuddy
The PlantBuddy project is an intelligent plant care system that uses a Raspberry Pi and sensor suite to mimic Southern Arizona's day/night light cycle and monitor soil moisture for succulent plants. It offers a user-friendly web interface for real-time and historical data and provides LED and web alerts for watering needs.
